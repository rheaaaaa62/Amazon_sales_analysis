# Amazon_sales_analysis
Exploring the Amazon Sales Dataset involves a step-by-step process. First, we clean and prepare the data to ensure it's accurate and consistent. Then, we summarize the data using descriptive statistics like averages and ranges. Next, we visualize the data with charts and graphs to see patterns and relationships. We detect outliers, which are unusual data points, and test our assumptions about the data. We divide the data into groups for better understanding and finally, we summarize our findings.
